- issue: server successfull handles request and creating and merging audio 
         + video but client before receiving the response fails with error: "Failed to Fetch" while using debugger no issue appears
    fix: added mimtype at backend so that browser can know what type of data is being received

- issue: on windows, got errors related to moviepy compatibility because of 
         ffmpeg
    fix: downgraded python version from 3.14 to 3.12 as new 3.14 not widely supportive for ffmpeg yet

- issue: converting text to speech with extension .mp3 not compatible
    fix: fixed by changing .mp3 to .wav

- issue: audio needed to be exact the same duration of video
    fix: added audio duration in generating voice from text using the video duration

- issue: after generating the audio res was a url of the resource
    fix: downloaded and saved the reseource into file after generating

- issue: re-rendering becomes expensive due to functions and components
    fix: optimised using useCallback and memo to avoid unnecessary re-rendering

- issue: even after just generating the voice right away, it again 
          generates as no donwload link was provided
    fix: added another download button to download
